# college_resource

This project is used for the booking of resources which are available in a college so as to better utilize them. It is a menu driven project in which we will be asked to login as an admin or as a member then you will allocate those resources with their time zone. Admin and member have certain privileges which will be displayed on the screen when you make your login. 


#Makefile
I have used traditional way of compiling all the header files. 
Go to GITBASH, then
Go in the folder where the all the executable files are,
the write the command 'mingw32-make -f makefile.txt all' -- all the files are compiled 
Now to get OUTPUT, 
./Folder_Name
